# TechEvoltion: How Code and World Going Boom

## 1. Introduct：Why tecnology is like a pizza

Technology, it come fast, like pizza delivery. But sometimes is cold, or topping is wrong.

So, we ask: **is all tech good, or just some tech pretending be good**?

Also: many peoples write code now, but do they really understand it?

## 2. Coding for Human and Cat 🤖🐱

Today everyones write code: even the cat maybe.

### Common language use by developer 2024:


1. JavaScripts
2. Python (snake not included 🐍)
3. Rust (not the old metal one)
4. GoLang (it go but sometimes doesn't)

但是在许多国家，初学者面对 coding 会说：

> “var 是什么鬼？”\
> “为什么 run 不起来？”\
> “为啥加了 async 还卡住？”

### Mistake code that still compile????

```python
def hello(name):
print("Hello," + name)

hello(  "Wolrd")
```
