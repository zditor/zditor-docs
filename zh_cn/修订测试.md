# How Technology Changes Our {{Lifes}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，"life"的复数形式为"lives"|advice=Lives)

In the modern world, {{tecnology}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=technology) {{have becoming}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=has become) {{a inportant}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=冠词和拼写错误|advice=an important) part of everyday life. {{From we wake up until go to sleep}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=表达不流畅，改为动名词短语更简洁|advice=From waking up until going to sleep), we are {{surrond}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=surrounded) by devices, apps and digital {{solusions}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=solutions) that {{claim make}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title="claim"后接不定式|advice=claim to make) life easier, but {{is it really so}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=提升表达的正式性和严谨性|advice=is that truly the case)? Let us {{explor}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=explore) how this evolution is both good and {{sometime}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=sometimes) {{dangeros}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=dangerous) to our {{lifes}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，"life"的复数形式为"lives"|advice=lives).

{{First of all}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=更简洁的序数词|advice=Firstly), the most {{obvius}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=obvious) impact of technology is in {{communcation}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=communication). In the past, sending a letter would take weeks, or even months. Now, with {{smart phones}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=常见复合词，通常合写|advice=smartphones) and social media {{platform}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=platforms), we can message someone {{across globe}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少定冠词|advice=across the globe). This {{have make}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=has made) distance seem shorter and global community more connected. However, {{sometime}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=sometimes) the {{quikness}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=quickness) of online chatting {{lead}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=leads) to less meaningful {{converstions}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=conversations), and people feel lonelier than before because they replace {{face to face talk}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=提升表达的正式性和准确性|advice=face-to-face interaction) with texting and emojis.

Secondly, in education, {{there been}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少助动词，应为现在完成时|advice=there have been) {{tremendeous}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=tremendous) changes. {{Online course}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=Online courses) and video lessons make it possible for {{student}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=students) from all {{background}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=backgrounds) to access knowledge. {{Especialy}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=Especially) during {{covid-19 pandamic}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=专有名词大小写及拼写错误|advice=COVID-19 pandemic), many {{shools}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=schools) and universities switched to online mode. This {{shown}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=has shown) how flexible and adaptive {{tecnology}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=technology) can be. But {{not all was perfect}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title="all"通常指可数名词，"everything"更适合指代一般情况|advice=not everything was perfect). Many {{childen}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=children) {{have dificult}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误且名词形式不正确|advice=had difficulty) to concentrate in virtual classroom, and also {{teacher who not trained good}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数、时态及副词使用错误|advice=teachers who were not well-trained) in digital tools {{was struggling}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态更简洁，与前文保持一致|advice=struggled) to keep students engaged. So, even if internet gave more resources, {{its not same like real class experience}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=冠词、连词及名词使用不当|advice=it's not the same as a real classroom experience).

Also the work environment {{have being affected}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成被动语态|advice=has been affected). Remote working, online meetings and cloud {{collabration}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=collaboration) tools {{are norm now}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少定冠词|advice=are the norm now). Workers can {{do task}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=动词和名词搭配更专业，且名词应为复数|advice=perform tasks) from home and even from different countries. It {{give}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=gives) more freedom and save commuting time. But {{on other side}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=常用习语|advice=on the other hand), many {{employee feel they working}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数及动词形式错误|advice=employees feel they are working) all the time, even at home. This blur of work-life balance can lead to burnout. {{Additinally}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=Additionally), not all jobs can be {{do}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=被动语态中动词应为过去分词|advice=done) remotely, which {{creat}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误且主谓不一致|advice=creates) a divide between {{type of employements}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，"employment"通常作不可数名词|advice=types of employment).

Health care also {{seen benefit}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误且名词应为复数|advice=has also seen benefits) of technology. With {{AI powered}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=复合形容词应加连字符|advice=AI-powered) diagnostics, robot-assisted surgeries and telemedicine, the quality and reach of care {{have improving}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=has improved). {{Patient}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=Patients) can consult doctors via apps and get prescriptions without {{visit hospital}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=动词形式及冠词使用错误|advice=visiting a hospital). But {{some issue arises}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数及主谓不一致|advice=some issues arise) like data privacy. How safe is our medical record {{on cloud}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=介词使用不当|advice=in the cloud)? Also, not everyone {{have knowledge}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致且缺少冠词|advice=has the knowledge) or device to use such services, especially {{elderlys}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=集体名词，指老年人|advice=the elderly).

The influence of {{tecnology}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=technology) on daily {{habit}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=habits) is {{enormus}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=enormous). We order food online, use GPS for directions, buy things through e-commerce website and even dating now {{happen}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=happens) on apps. While all these {{make task}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=make tasks) more {{conveneint}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=convenient), it also made us more {{dependents}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=形容词形式错误|advice=dependent). If internet {{go down}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=goes down), many people don't know how to do basic {{thing}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=things) anymore. Like reading {{paper map}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=a paper map), cooking {{own food}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少物主代词|advice=their own food), or going to {{bank physically}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=a bank physically). The art of patience and waiting is disappearing, because everything must be instant now.

Moreover, social media {{create a illussion}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误、主谓不一致及冠词使用错误|advice=creates an illusion) of perfection. People post the best {{moment of their life}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=名词单复数及拼写错误|advice=moments of their lives), filtered and {{edit}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=动词形式错误，应为过去分词|advice=edited), making {{other feels}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数及动词形式错误|advice=others feel) inadequate. It {{cause}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=causes) mental health issues, anxiety and low self-esteem in {{youngs}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=更正式和准确的表达|advice=young people). Likes and comments {{become way}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=become a way) to measure self-worth, which is not healthy. Also, spreading of misinformation is easy now. Anyone can post anything and if it goes viral, truth {{don’t matter}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=doesn't matter).

In terms of environment, {{techonolgy}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=technology) is {{double edge sword}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词且复合形容词应加连字符|advice=a double-edged sword). On one hand, we have renewable energy, electric vehicles, smart grids which help reduce carbon footprints. But on the other, mass production of {{gadget}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=gadgets), e-waste and server farms {{consume lot of energy}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=consume a lot of energy). Mining of rare earth metals for phones and {{battery}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=batteries) {{cause damage}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=causes damage) to {{eco-systems}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=常见拼写|advice=ecosystems). So, while we {{solve some problem}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=solve some problems), we create new ones.

Another concern is about children. Kids today grow up with screens {{infront of}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，应为两个单词|advice=in front of) them. They play less outside, have lower physical activity, and sometimes {{expose to}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=被动语态错误|advice=are exposed to) harmful content early. {{Parent need}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=Parents need) to monitor, but often even they are not aware {{what the kids are doing online}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=提升表达的正式性和一致性|advice=what their children are doing online). Addiction to games, short video apps is {{real problem}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=a real problem), causing sleep issues and bad {{behaviours}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=美式拼写，与文章整体风格保持一致|advice=behaviors).

In addition, the rise of AI and automation {{bring worry}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=更正式和准确的表达|advice=raises concerns) to job security. Many {{repetative}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=repetitive) jobs are now done by machine. Factory workers, cashiers, even content writers are replaced or assisted by AI. While it {{increase effeciency}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误且主谓不一致|advice=increases efficiency), it also {{mean}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=means) {{less job for human}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=可数名词用"fewer"，且应为复数|advice=fewer jobs for humans). We must think about reskilling and how to prepare for jobs {{for tommorrow}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=介词使用错误且拼写错误|advice=of tomorrow). Otherwise, inequality between skilled and unskilled {{worker}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=workers) will {{grow more}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=更准确的副词|advice=grow further).

Now, look at relationships. Online dating, virtual friends and {{long distance relations}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误且名词单复数错误|advice=long-distance relationships) {{are norm}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少定冠词|advice=are the norm). While it {{connect}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=connects) people beyond borders, it also {{remove}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=removes) the intimacy of {{real time interactions}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=复合形容词应加连字符|advice=real-time interactions). Many {{couple complain}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=couples complain) of emotional disconnect, and ghosting {{become common term}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误且缺少冠词|advice=has become a common term). Trust {{become harder}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=becomes harder) when anyone can {{fake identity}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少冠词|advice=fake an identity) or hide truth behind a screen.

Of course, not everything is bad. Technology {{help}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=helps) disabled people to live better {{lifes}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，"life"的复数形式为"lives"|advice=lives). With assistive devices, voice commands, and accessibility apps, {{barrier are broken}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=barriers are broken). People can now read with screen readers, move with {{wheelchairs that powered by}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=表达更简洁|advice=wheelchairs powered by) brain signals, and even communicate with speech disabilities through AI. These are amazing {{advancement}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=advancements).

Transportation {{become smarter}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=has become smarter) too. With {{ride-sharing}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=复合形容词应加连字符|advice=ride-sharing) apps, smart traffic management, autonomous vehicles in development, we move faster and better. But it also {{cause}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=causes) traditional jobs like {{taxi driver}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=taxi drivers) to become less stable. Also, people get frustrated when apps glitch or when they rely too much on automation. A GPS error can lead you {{completely wrong place}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少介词和冠词|advice=to a completely wrong place).

Culturally, {{tecnology allowed}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误且时态错误，应为现在完成时|advice=technology has allowed) exposure to global ideas. You can {{listen music}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少介词|advice=listen to music) from Africa, watch dramas from Korea, or learn cooking from Italian grandma online. This fusion of culture is beautiful, but it also sometimes {{cause loss}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致且缺少冠词|advice=causes a loss) of local traditions. {{Youngs}}(style=indigo|mode=revision|title=更正式和准确的表达|advice=Young people) prefer global trends, and forget {{roots}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少物主代词|advice=their roots). Balance must be {{maintain}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=被动语态中动词应为过去分词|advice=maintained).

Security is another issue. With everything online, {{cyber attack increase}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误且应为现在进行时，表示持续趋势|advice=cyberattacks are increasing). Hackers {{target bank, hospital, even government}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误且应使用并列连词|advice=target banks, hospitals, and even governments). Data breach can ruin {{life}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，"life"的复数形式为"lives"|advice=lives). People must learn about strong password, {{2-factor authantication}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误且应使用完整单词|advice=two-factor authentication), and be careful what they share online. But still, {{system get hacked}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误且应为被动语态|advice=systems are hacked). Technology must be secure by design, but in rush to launch new feature, security often {{ignore}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=被动语态错误|advice=is ignored).

{{Looking future}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少介词和冠词|advice=Looking to the future), things like quantum computing, brain-computer interface, smart cities are coming. They offer exciting {{posibility}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=possibility), but also ethical {{question}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=questions). Who {{control}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=controls) the data? How much privacy {{we willing}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=缺少助动词|advice=are we willing) to lose for {{convienence}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误|advice=convenience)? Will AI become too smart? Will {{human}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=humans) become lazy because of automation? All {{this}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=表达更完整|advice=of this) must be {{discuss openly}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=被动语态中动词应为过去分词|advice=discussed openly).

To conclude, technology is neither good {{or}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=与"neither"搭配的连词应为"nor"|advice=nor) bad. It is a tool, and how we use it {{define}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=defines) the result. It {{make many thing}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致且名词单复数错误|advice=makes many things) better, faster and easier. But also, it {{bring}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=主谓不一致|advice=brings) challenges in mental health, environment, job security, and human {{relation}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=relations). We must learn to use it {{wisefully}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，应为副词"wisely"|advice=wisely), teach our children good {{habit}}(style=yellow|mode=revision|title=名词单复数错误，应为复数|advice=habits), and not forget the simple joy of offline life.

Maybe, sometimes, we just need to unplug, and {{breath}}(style=green|mode=revision|title=拼写错误，应为动词"breathe"|advice=breathe).
