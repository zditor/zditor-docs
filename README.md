## Getting Started

Zditor is a WYSIWYG markdown editor that supports basic markdown syntax and extends upon it. It currently supports `Windows`, `Macos`, and `Linux` platforms. To download, please visit the [release download page](https://github.com/zditor/zditor-docs/releases).

### Demo Video

[Simple Demo of Zditor](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sKZPYBEJA/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=1974ff0cf0dde44aad6580cca6526a34)

### Signature Issue

- `Macos` currently does not have a signature. After downloading, two additional steps are required: during installation and the first time opening the app, `go to Privacy & Security in Settings and select "Open Anyway."`

### LLM Model Configuration

Uses OpenAI SDK's streaming output, supporting both API and local models. As shown in the image below, you can fill in the relevant parameters. For the model section, separate the entries with commas (English commas). The `ollama` API key can be left blank.

### LLM Usage

Supports text selection and a separate chat tab. Text selection is for single-round conversations, while the chat tab supports multi-round conversations, file uploads, selecting documents as context, drag-and-drop uploads, etc.

### License

A free license is provided. Simply enter your email, click "Send," and then retrieve the license from your email.
